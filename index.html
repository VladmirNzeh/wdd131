            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Emmanuel Chidiebere Nzeh. I am from Lagos, Nigeria, and a native of Imo State. I come from an extended family with a Christian background. Some of my hobbies and interests include research, photography, modeling, content creation, coding, hanging out, tourism, skating, reading, exercising, and traveling.
                    I am currently a student at Brigham Young Universityâ€“Idaho, where I am pursuing a major in Web and Computer Programming. I am also a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
                    I enjoy foods that are rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. While I am not a shy person, I can be somewhat introverted, especially when meeting new people for the first time.
